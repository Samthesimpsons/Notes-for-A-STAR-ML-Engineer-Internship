# Deeplearning
My notes I did for my ML Engineer summer internship at A*STAR. Studied PCA and various machine learning techniques from Data Driven Science & Engineering Machine Learning, Dynamical Systems, and Control written by Steven L. Brunton

Studied everything from this playlist:

Added my own notes too from the textbook and codes, mainly for PCA only which was used for my data science internship at A*STAR

## Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch
Learning with PyTorch

Tutorial Series on PyTorch
1. Deep Learning with PyTorch by Sentdex Series
2. Stefan Otte: Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch | PyData Berlin 2018

Codes taken from their various Githubs and Online resources:
1. https://github.com/sotte/pytorch_tutorial
2. https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-deep-learning-neural-network-pytorch/

Edited the notebooks and arranged them to my perferences. Added my own individual comments and notes from both series.

## Python 
Also added an intermediate python guide for functions such as enumerate, zip etc.
